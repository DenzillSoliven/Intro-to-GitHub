i dont typically post reviews and clearly ocvh does not need me to vouch for them but they are a truly incredible practice thanks to a referral from another lifelong customer of theirs i brought my critically ill parrot to dr briggs in 2015 following numerous visits to emergency hospitals with no resolution dr briggs not only saved his life but took the time to educate me on how to provide him with the best ongoing care i cant stress enough how poor the outcome was looking before his treatment i only wish i had found him sooner it is now 2018 and i have been back regularly for routine checkups and grooms with briggs i do not have a negative thing to say about a single experience i have had my parrot has been sneezing recently so i spoke to kathy who is always wonderful who assisted in providing me with a recommendation from dr gottlieb to bring him in sooner rather than later if possible bird owners know that seemingly minor symptoms can turn serious very quickly she then made me an appointment for the same day with dr crawford as briggs was not working dr crawford was awesome caring patient knowledgeable and educational i already had complete trust in this practice but getting to meet another doctor here made me love them even more the technician and csr staff supporting the superhero vets here are just good people i dont know how to put it more simply everyone i have interacted with has been professional friendly warm and caring everyone even the staff members that walk by go out of their way to acknowledge me and say hello excitedly to my bird its obvious they are passionate about animals and see them in the same special way that all animal lovers do i have the utmost respect for their dedication sensitivity and empathy especially considering the emotion and stress that comes with their line of work i have to mention melissa in particular we both met each other on our first days at ocvh just from opposite ends of the counter she is an excellent example of what makes this practice so special niko is also fairly often the lucky tech that has to wipe bird poop up during our visits thanks man to wrap this novel up i feel very fortunate to have this team and would recommend them with absolute confidence to anyone i was abused as a child and crossing paths with my parrot 14 years ago saved my life and got me through it of course the people at ocvh dont know that but that is exactly the point i dont have to explain to them how much i love my parrot or how important his wellbeing is to me they understand that already and apply that level of care to all of their patients i just hope the entire team knows how significant their efforts are for people like me thank you,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

my rabbit died in their care during a regular spaying from the start i should have known better than to go here when i first needed to make an appointment i had to call 34 times and leave a message for the manager who never called me back then once i actually got the appointment they called me about an hour before the appointment because the surgeon called in sick then once i actually brought her there all they did was weigh her check her to make sure she was a girl then took her away no exam infront of me didnt ask me any questions about her nothing later on that day i got a call asking if i consent to cpr then a call saying she passed they gave me my money back and paid for her cremation i got to say goodbye to my baby and the only explanation i got was that she was fine after surgery but 2 hours after her temperature dropped then she died i asked if she was monitored at all and they told me she was she was next to a dog in critical condition during recovery so there had to be staff around her i had a woman from the nj house rabbit society follow up with them and the story they gave her was completly different than what i was told they told her she passed due to her bleeding more than usual if she bled more than usual then stop the surgery and save the life of my bunny or watch her closer during recovery i believe they did not tell me the truth and she was not watched as well as they said she was i got more sympathy and compassion from the woman at the house rabbit society than the office manager there im sure this vet is more than fine with dogs and cats but if you have a small animal please dont go here for surgery there are plenty of other specialists who give you more one on one care than here im sure they did not mean to harm her in anyway but after reading all these negative reviews from small animalexotic animal owners they probably shouldnt be working on small animals and just stick with dogs  cats not only is my family heartbroken but my other 6 year old rabbit is left without his partner,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

for the most part the staff at ocvh are incredibly kind and caring i had brought my kitten to the jackson location multiple times for kitten care and always had a great experience the only reason i have mixed feelings is that i had to bring my kitten in when he stopped eating and was vomiting they took an xray and ultrasound and confirmed that he had an obstruction in his stomach  2500 later i found out that there was no obstruction and that the surgery was not needed i wish more could have been done in ways of blood tests to see if he really had an obstruction or if it was slight inflammation of the gi tract and a very mild bout of pancreatitis which is what he really had they didnt run run blood tests before the surgery to see if there was an alternative and in the end the surgery was a hinder to my kittens recovery they wanted me to keep him there for overnight fluids for two days but at this point i didnt have anymore money saved they wanted another 700 and they dont even have anyone on staff from 10pm to 7am so if anything went wrong no one would be there to help i decided to take the fluids medications and my kitten home with me it took a lot of tlc and some syringe feeding but he got better  i have been trying to contact them for some more information on aftercare but no one is getting back to me i know they truly believed they saw an obstruction in his intestines but they misdiagnosed my kitten and didnt seem to blink an eye when i explained to them how upset i was that they had to cut my already sick cat open for no reason and then proceed to charge me full price   pros caring staff great same day service cons misdiagnosis,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i have been going here with my older dog for almost nine years and my other dog for six years i was on the pet plan and went to collect flea and worming treatments as required i always had text message reminders monthly for this and for upcoming vaccinations when i went recently i was told my dog had missed their vaccination booster by four months  included in my pet plan and had to start the course again which i now had to pay for i was surprised by this as had no reminder on checking the vaccination record i realised this was right however had not checked this myself due to previous reminders when asked i was told they were changing systems and a reminder is a courtesy thing not happy at all with this response and walked out cancelled my pet plan and now looking for somewhere else    i never requested reminders but felt it was a nice touch and admit i became reliant on this you should have notified customers if not offering this service anymore bad customer service in my opinion,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

the vet southampton 4 years ago i paid 10month for insurance to cover flea treatment  vaccination and 2 vet consultations the next year it went up to 1250 then last year and this year up again   and the vet consultations were removed but the reason for only 2 stars is that i took my beloved cat in yesterday as an emergency because she woke up really poorly and crying  after a few tests i was told they can do nothing for her and i was taken to a room to wait for them to prepare the injection i only just sat down and was in total shock and crying when the door opened and in walked someone with a cash machine asking me to pay for my visit   i was totally shocked  i had rushed out without my wallet thankfully i had my bank app on my phone so could pay them as requested    ive never encountered such a lack of empathy usually payment is requested after the event   someone at ho needs to think again about this unfeeling money grabbing practise   i can never recommend any of my friends to come here  which is a shame because the vets are really lovely,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

incompetent vets  i am writing this review with a heavy heart and anger i feel towards the vet in millbrook southampton who failed my 2 week old puppy the lack of competence and negligence displayed by these supposed professionals has left me mourning the loss of my puppy  i noticed some concerning symptoms with my puppy worried about its wellbeing i took it to the first vet to assured me over the phone before taking my puppy in that she was fine the vet advised that the reason my puppy was in distress was down to a skin condition and i should give her a bath trusting their expertise i felt relieved and left  45 hours later and my puppy evidently deteriorating i rushed my puppy to another vet as soon as they saw my puppy they were able to tell me she was suffering with pneumonia and fluid on her lungs these vets advised it was cruel to keep her alive however my puppy decided to pass on her own just moments later  the lack of professionalism and care demonstrated by the vets in millbrook is simply inexcusable it was evident they are clearly not interested they dismissed all my concerns without conducting a thorough examination it is clear the vets primary concern is not the wellbeing of animals but rather their own convenience and profit  i urge all pet owners to think twice before allowing their animals to be taken into the care of this vets,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

im absolutely disgusted by how the vet handles loyal customers ive been their customer for 4 years since moving to the uk i set up a healthcare plan last year for my dog to benefit the free consultation and treatments they offer within their policy in the beginning of this year they changed their policy they offer only one free health check up now and only 10 off of dental treatments compared to the previous 2 annual free check ups and 30 off of dental treatment and they implemented and extra mandatory health check up to get the worm and flee treatment so since i saw i barely benefit anything from the health plan i cancelled it very easy straight forward they told me on the phone it okay you can cancel only a week later i received a letter that i owe them 6616  apparently i couldnt cancel the health care plan before the 1 year period which i wasnt made aware of i never received any information regarding the terms and conditions they have not made me aware of the cancellations policy when i asked about the policy they sent me a leaflet where instead of highlighting the policy they covered it after being 1 week late for the payment which i intended to pay in the first place they forwarded the claim to a debt collector company  after being 1 week late from the original deadline  i ended up paying 15616 instead of 6616  expensive lesson know your terms and conditions folks because even your local vet will try to scam you they apparently can change the terms and conditions as they wish and after actually making me pay for the extra 4 months left from the year they told me they wont provide their services for my dog i can only assume that they dont understand legal terms and conditions they should provide their treatment for the rest of the period as they made me pay for the rest of the 12 month of the policy this is the leaflet they sent me with the highlighted policy absolute scammers,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i could go into countless details regarding our practice in north harbour but well start with the most recent issue our dog went in for a spay and naturally we asked if theyd be okay to also trim her nails as its service they offer firstly due to some concern about her bleeding from a phantom pregnancy they promised theyd call us when she went into surgery which they didnt when we called after 4 hours they informed us she had been for about 30 mins in the past theyve allowed her to chew through several plastic pieces on the cage and even once told us to make sure she passes plastic in her poo as shed eaten cannula lines during her stay so once again we picked her up to find out theyd allowed her to chew through her lead for the 3rd time after getting her back from her spay we noticed that she had minor bleeding from one of her claws upon inspection the claw had been cut back within an inch of her actual paw and the quick was exposed we do understand shes fidgety and difficult but she would have been sedated and we were never even informed that she had this injury when she left these are the few examples not to mention when our dog went in for sickness and when we saw the receipt theyd sedated her twice without informing us they only told us they were giving her fluids our dogs always come home hugely dehydrated after hours staying there for what was just meant to be a check up im just so dissapointed as it always feels like theyre more interested in the money not the animals,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

a while ago they were okwalk in clinic which was very convenient for many people i suppose prices were also very good a good strategy to get clients than boom no more walk in only appointments which you can not get very soon prices exploded a written prescription as an example from 1050 suddenly became 22 appointment prices doubled one of my dogs have a history of eye ulcers so i know she will get it when i see her symptoms i went to them been given antibiotics and been told i must come back in one week when i called and told them my dog if fine i have been told that it is an emergency and i have to come in so they can check if she is ok i know when my dog is ok and when she is not so i had to change them after 23 years with them because i just had enough and this are just a few things that are wrong with them,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i cancelled my health plan as i was extremely disappointed with the serviceÂ Â i paid pet ins 1625 per month which worked out 4875 for 3 months almost 200 per year which is mostly for flea treatment and 1 worm tablet 12 every 6 monthsÂ Â whilst i understand that did include two visits a year no charge and anal glands expressed and nail cutting service i still think its an expensive service for a tiny chihuahua when the service is poorÂ Â within 11 months i had to contact practice twice as to why i hadnt received his treatmentÂ Â reason for the first time was one system had my new address and the other computer system had my old addressÂ Â the last reason i was told was for some reason there was a suspended notice showing against my delivery which prevented a notification going through that the prescription needed updated and the practice couldnt figure out whyÂ Â this was just not acceptable and not a beneficial service worth paying forÂ Â Â   Â sadly i feel this practice is in the business of selling products and proceduresÂ  i am unhappy with the practice over charging for products as i paid 3207 191022 for 6 tablets for a skin allergy which i found i could buy online for 006 each albeit with a vet prescription but still shows how much profit is made and 1 x douro mousse which i could also buy online for 1221Â Â i understand as a business they must make money but surely you should advise clients that the items could be purchased much cheaper onlineÂ  Â  also i was quoted between 480 600  to receive dental care for my tiny chihuahua whichÂ would include him undergoing an xray to see extent of problem of his gums but they would only be able to determine the cost if he had the xray but it would have to be under anaestheticÂ Â i was really upset that this couldnt have been done whilst he hadÂ already had anaesthetic late september 2022 for another procedure i paid the practice for as it wasnt covered by my insuranceÂ  Â Â i did ask for the dental procedure xray etc to be done whilst he was under anaesthetic in sept 2022 but was told no as it was a different procedure yet during that procedure they extracted 23 teethÂ Â i dont understand why anyone would be willing to put him through it again within only weeks of him having it for the fact is he is a tiny dog under 3kg in weightÂ  i can only surmise it is for financial gain and not worry about the risk to his health,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
edit after response from the vet no conclusion was reached other than the admit of fault and refund of 44 no explanation as to why they vet felt she was in the right to overcharge   the nottingham well what can i say i am absolutely devastatingly appalled by the treatment we have received today i have always sung their praise in past years since being taken over the service is just not the same it makes me sad as i loved the practice and staff before i took in our cat billy today he began choking this morning this has happened before he had something lodged in his throat i knew this was the case again as his behaviour was exactly the same trying to bring it up the consultation this morning resulted in him being sent away with a anti sickness injection he was still trying to cough up whatever was stuck but you seemed to think this wasnt the case you were negligent in not reading previous notes and listening to our concerns on the way home we were really concerned so rang back you asked us to bring him down again you said you could do the sedation and look into his throat but it was up to us as you didnt think that you would find anything not at any point this you recommend this be your course of action it was only done at our insistence i get a call from a nurse advising me that you removed a 5cm blade of grass stuck in his throat and up into his nose you would have left him to suffer in pain through the rest of the day night and morning you have even had the nerve to charge us for being seen twice this should have been 1 consultation how vulgar of you we challenged this in practice but you would not back down i am reaching out to the rcvs to raise my concerns as yes you have been negligent but not only this you have taken advantage of my care as a owner and over charged me in consultation fees,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i attended the vet in southampton after my dog cut himself on some barbed wire hes a working dog so used to getting the odd knock and cut but this required stiches when i phone the vet i explained exactly what was needed ie clean around the cut some local anaesthetic and stich up i said he wont need sudation if im with him i know my dog this was really a very simple job for then to do which wouldnt have taken any more that 10  15 minutes  i arrived and they took the dog away i said that i wanted to go with him to make it easier for the vet and keep the dog calm they wouldnt let me go with the dog despite the receptionist saying that i could the vet comes out to see me 5 minutes later and say oh is bad hes done a right job on that hasnt he well its a cut thats quite deep i said thats why ive brought him here its very straight forward you clean it up a bit of local and stich him up hell be right as rain oh no she said well need to sedate him and its difficult to stich so the price will be 530 i couldnt believe the price they were trying to charge me so i asked how she arrived at that price well thats what we charge to stich a 3cm cut this was a 100  120 job tops and they just wanted to try and exploit the fact that they had the dog there and though i had no other choice well they were wrong i asked them to fetch me my dog the vet then said oh well perhaps youd like me to give them some paid relief no i dont the dog isnt in pain  when leaving the vet said and this is the best bit if you find a vet that will do it cheaper then we will price match unbelievable  anyhow i took my dog home put some local anaesthetic spray on cleaned him up shaved the area and stitched him up myself with my wifes help i didnt have proper suturing thread so once sown up i put a bit of super glue on to help hold it together some antibiotic spray i use for the sheep and hes healed up a treat a couple of doggie treats for him and pint of beer for me and all is well  shame on the vets oh and theyve sent me a bill for the consultation dont think thats going to be paid,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
on saturday  my cat was brought in and my son was given a quote of 490 for xrays  and treatment  and when he offered to pay the amount in whole  he was informed by whoever was on the front desk  that he should pay only half then  when my cat was examined i received a phone call  from the vet kajani paheerathan that the treatment of xrays etc  was now more than 600 and my cat would need surgery at a cost of 3000 etc i explained to her on saturday morning that i could not afford this amount in one go  and this vets do not do any type of pay in instalments schemes  the vet offered no alternative suggestions or advice  regarding for example diet  or my cat getting sunshine etc so he could also heal naturally it was although she had selected hearing when i explained that i could not afford 3000 in one sum and no this vets does not want whats best for my cat later on that day  i once again received a phone call from kajani paheerathan  explaining once again we want whats best for your cat no you dont  as i already explained i couldnt afford 3000 to pay for surgeryand no alternative once again was offered except you will have to look for charitiesok on saturday when my cat was brought home  the dressing that kajani paheerathan had placed on my cats leg had come off and it was to late to bring my cat back and i had loss all confidence in this vet  on tuesday a lovely lady called hannah from the vet phoned and gave me some names of charities  when once again i explained that unless there was something in place to pay by instalments id be unable to continue treatment with my cat at the vet  she at least sounded sympathetic so since tuesday ive been doing my absolute best to find a cat charity to carry on treating my cat so imagine my shock when today i received an unpleasant email from kajani paheerathan wanting details of where my cat is now being treated  otherwise im going to be reported etc i have been treated in an appalling way by this vet its not every body there but its by the aforementioned vet if this vet is really so concerned about my cats welfare  then carry on treating my cat and let me pay in installments  dont not treat my cat  especially when ive been honest and state i cannot afford more than 3000 in one go and then send me an email 4 days later  when ive done my absolute best to find an alternative place to deal with my cat,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i called to advise my cat was not very well and i did emphasis she needs an emergency appointment and was given a time of 20 to 11 to bring her in on that phone call i did not disclose i was having to self isolate as i was too concerned with the well being of my cat i called back after speaking to track and trace to find out what my options were and called the vet back and was advised i could not leave the cat outside to which i asked if someone else could and i was refused this option my cat could have been seen this morning had i not been refused help for a sick animal and she is now on her way to the rspca in salford the lady from the rspca called you back to ask if she could take my cat and she was advised i wasnt refused due to isolation i was refused due to no staff but you had staff for the 20 to 11 emergency appointment i was given in the first phone call if you would have allowed me to have someone else bring her to the door  i was told i could not bring my cat as she may have covid on her which is utterly ridiculous do your staff not attend the supermarket the gym pubs restaurants there is more risk in your staff attending these places than their is me having someone who does not have covid leave my cat outside so she can get the care she needs a few hours after i was denied help by yourselves we discovered she had missing teeth and had possibly been ran over to lie to the rspca about denying my cat help is appalling to deny an animal help in general is against your duty of care as a veterinary practice a hospital would not refuse a person so why would a vet refuse an animal if my child was seriously ill and needed emergency care a doctor would not refuse to see them because their mum had covid they would be struck off as a vet how is this any different for animals to penalise animals because an owner is having to isolate is disgusting and possibly life threatening  all the calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes so you can bring that telephone conversation up and discuss amongst yourselves how you are going to deal with situations like this again going forward hopefully in a more caring and professional manor  my cat has been delayed care for 8 hours including the time it has taken the rspca who are doing their jobs correctly to collect my cat and take her to their vet in salford  if anything happens to her having been delayed the care i will hold you personally responsible and advise you train your staff and management on how to deal with isolation and animal emergencies we have been in this pandemic for nearly 2 years i think you are due a training day this should not happen to anyone having to isolate with a sick pet i would not be raising this complaint if i was advised in the first instance you had no staff due to an outbreak of covid within your vet but i was given a time to bring her in and then denied its immoral i then received a phone call after sending the above complaint from the lady who took this complaint very personally as the first thing she said was let me just say this first i am not a liar and began to raise her voice at me not letting me speak was very rude the complaint was addressed to a manager not the customer care advisor i got a bad attitude from someone in a customer care role  red flag she mockingly said you didnt even know your cat had been ran over she denied my cat access to care and now she has been put down by the rspca who god love them came and took her for me to a vet that phone call felt like she was the one raising a complaint with me if the manager speaks to me in the same manor i will be going to the bvaombudsmanqcc or anyone who will listen i did not raise a formal complaint to be shouted at by a customer care advisor with no care,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i recently went to the vet for pets at 21 23 kings rd sutton coldfield to show them a video of my dog a pug that i believe  has kennel cough the reason why i didnt take her is that the last time she went there was for her course of injections that i paid upfront for when she was a pup that cost over 100 however she only had 3 injections as the vet refused to give her the fourth one unless she was sudated as she hated going to the vets she was stressed out and would take days to recover i said so you want to give her an injection so that you can give her an injection he replied possibly yes which i felt would stress her out even more so we could not complete the course however today i asked them to view a recording my dog that i think has kennel cough the secretaries refused without even consulting the vet and said no the vet needs to exam the dog i told her i dont have a problem with paying for a vet to look at the recording exslained what had happened last time but she said the vet needs to look at the dog just incase something else is wrong i know for a fact this is possible as my daughter showed a recording of her dog that is a staff as at the time she had no way of getting the dog there the vet looked at the recording made a diagnoses then they went and paid when they collected the medication so it is obvious its because they could charge more for the vet to look at the dog i would have understood it if the vet looked at the video then said they need to see the dog so just like the injections i had already paid for they found another way of making a charge up ie to sudate the dog to complete the prepaid service,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

the portsmouth branch on binnacle way is a completely unprofessional veterinary practice  i initially called in mid may to enquire whether my dog can have her anal glands expressed as my vet was fully booked for another few days to which the receptionist advised that my dog will need to be registered with the practice so i went ahead and registered we have just moved so this is the closest practice anyways i spelled out my name using the phonetic alphabet to make sure no mistakes are made as the spelling of my name is complicated once registered the receptionist only decided to tell me then that in order for my dog to be seen she will need to have a checkup which will cost an additional 45 as she is new to the practice so 67 in total when she only needed her anal glands doneand her last checkup was in feb so she wasnt even due one rather than advising me about this extra cost prior to registering and querying whether i would rather go to the vets i was registered with as then that extra cost would be avoided  as embarrassing as it is i think most people are struggling financially so this was completely immoral and i felt as if ive been scammed i then had to book appointment for my dog to be seen as she needed a prescription so i called and organised an appointment for today 030623  0835 i got there early at 0825 and daisy was second in line to be seen but the receptionist told me that the vet was running late  at around 0845 the receptionist came over to advise that there was a system mishap and the vet was not scheduled to start until 9am at around 0915 the first dogs was seen and then at around 0945 daisy was finally called into the room  1 hour 15 minutes after our allocated appointment i was in the room for around 10 minutes i asked for the prescription and the vet also recommended antihistamines which he said were just over 11 for 5 days to which i agreed when i left the room i was asked to wait until the prescription was readythis was so that i could get her meds online when i finally got the prescription i checked and saw that my forename surname and dogs age was completely wrong which i highlighted to the receptionist who then had to change the prescription causing further delay my dogs dob is august 2014 and they miraculously came up with september 2016 and as mentioned when registering i spelled out my name using the phonetic alphabet to ensure no mistakes are made had i not noticed this the prescription would have been rejected and my dog wouldve had to wait far longer to receive her medication when i finally got the prescription with the correct details on it they failed to add the antihistamines that i asked for  the receptionist asked the vet about this and he said that he thought i didnt want them as they were 13 when he clearly gave me a price just over 11 and i clearly advised at the end of the appointment that i would like them also to which he confirmed as the price difference was not much i advised again that i would like these and the receptionist asked me to sit down and wait whilst this got organised at this point the level of unprofessionalism incompetency and complete disregard to the inconvenience caused to me and my dog my blood started to boil and i advised to just forget about it and to take the payment so that i can leave  i left at 1017 1 hour and 47 minutes after my allocated appointment  not once was i offered an apology nevermind compensation for the terrible service and inconvenience  the appointment was specifically booked for early morning whilst it was still cool outside to avoid the heat when walking to and from the appointment as i do not own a vehicle i hope this detailed review will allow for others to make an informed decision when considering registering their beloved pet with this practice,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

my cat lala is most likely poisoned by one of my garden plants it is a young cat who likes to hunt insects i have seen many times how together with the fly she caught a piece of the soft plant in her mouth i have checked the plants in my garden and there are a minimum of ten of them that are poisonous to cats i wanted to start lalas tests in this direction ie take a vomit sample and urine for analysis or at least discuss this test direction unfortunately my observations and fears were ignored i was told to continue with the next tests that were discussed with the vet earlier ie a scan and xray from the research that has been done so far many diseases have been ruled out another examination to be carried out is a scan and an xray looking for objects i understand that the vet wants to rule out as many causes of lalas malaise as possible but what i dont understand is why the vet is not taking the owners observations and opinion into account its been ten days since lala is ill i suspect the vet are not prepared for cats that have poisoned themselves with plants id only rather be honestly informed about it than ignored another thing is that lalas fur has been shaved in three places to take a blood sample  another thing which i will also mention is that after the sterilization operation the cat was bleeding from the reproductive organs for three weeks which is a dangerous side effect of sterilization  i am very sorry to give such a low mark to this clinic because very nice people work there but i am even more sorry to look at the complications and suffering of my cat,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i dont even know where to start  i think it is every pets owner worse nightmare to take their pet basically family member to the vets and to then not return with them but it happens we know animals have to get put down sometimes  however we took my cat in thursday 275 in the morning to be neutered a simple procedure we had an update few hours later saying he is fine we then get a call saying our cat milo has somehow ended up in the ceiling of the vets the fire brigade has been called and couldnt get him down as the ceiling structure isnt strong enough  initially this was quite funny as its just such a typical cat thing however it then dawned on us why is there a hole in the ceiling in the recovery room its common knowledge cats seek higher surfaces as it makes them feel safer its also a vets surely a ferret bird other animal could so easily do the same thing   i was at work during all of this but my dad goes to the vets at their closing time as they still havent been able to retrieve him when he gets there theyre somewhat apologetic and dad has a look for himself and is unable to find milo they then say theyve laid a trap and going to hopefully trap him and grab him but that theyve got to shut the vets  i cannot believe that after they lost our cat through negligence and lack of health and safety that they would then be happy to go home knowing a family has to go to bed without their pet they were happy to shut the vets and leave a cat stranded in the ceiling  it is currently the morning where i still dont have my cat and i am absolutely mortified that we would take my cat in for a simple procedure and the vet lost my cat  not to state the obvious but we also pay our yearly fee with the vet and for the procedure etc so i just want to understand exactly what are we paying for them,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i am totally disappointed at the service provided by the vet nottingham in bilborough and the way its staff wanted to handle this issue is absolutely unprofessional we took our dog to the vet nottingham in bilborough on monday because our dog was screaming from pain the vet said that the dog has a problem with his knee cap that was the reason why he was under a lot of pain he got painkillers onlythe next day the dog was still crying from pain and he was very weak he could hardly walk he couldnt eat and drink i was trying to give him water with a syringe trying to find out what caused this pain and that was when i noticed that there is a huge wound on his neck photo attached i was called today by one of the staff members and the way she wanted to handle this issue is absolutely outrageous 1 she told me that it was our fault that we failed to see the wound under the collar not the doctors 2 she said that the doctor did not see the wound because it was not there 3 she said that the wound must have been so small that the collar covered totally covered it that is why the doctor didnt notice this this is not true the diameter of the wound is approximately 3 cms the collar is 1 cm wide if the vet had taken a look at the dogs neck he would have noticed it 4 then she accused us of shaving the skin around the wound that is why it looks so big in the photo that i had sent her i told her that it is absolutely not true how could i have shaved a pusser a very bad wound it is absolutely impossible 5 i told her that i want to take the dog to her immediately so she can see the wound and prove to her the we were not lying but she refused she did not want to see the dog i asked her several times to please take a look at it but she didnt let me go there 6 the doctor failed to notice the wound however he spent quite a long time explaining my husband what my dog needs xray operation heart checkup medication etc i wish he had concentrated more on examining my dog than the finances 7 however the doctor knew that our 10yearold dog has serious heart problems he still insisted on a surgery he must know  even i know and i am not a vet  that it is very risky to put such an old dog with serious heart conditions to sleep before surgery in conclusion i am totally dissatisfied with the vet nottinghams service and the way they wanted to handle this issue we would have deserved an apology for all this but instead the staff member who called us today blamed us and wanted to make us feel bad for not noticing the wound and accused us for shaving the skin around the wound to make it look bigger i do not recommend the vet nottingham in bilborough to anyone ps they did not even apologise i would also like to mention that the staff member who called me asked me to remove my previous bad review in return for her help which i did but then i didnt get any help instead i was blamed for not noticing the wound on my dogs neck and accused of lying,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
i want to let people know what happened to us when we took a stray cat that was known to us and had been independently living around us for a while  when i say independently he came to us if he was hungry or needed shelter in one of the outside sheds  he didnt want to stay in the house with our other pets but enjoyed a cuddle now and again but he liked his independence which we respected  the cat in question was injured recently so we phoned the rspca who advised us to take the cat to a vet and they would pay for the treatment  when my partner and my 15yr old daughter who had become very attached to the cat took him to the vet they were met with 2 options either they handed the cat over to them or we had to take financial responsibility for the cat  we were told an xray was required and that would be between 300 and 400 pounds and then if an operation was required it would be in excess of 150000p there was no possibility that we could find that particularly during this covid19 period   we do not claim benefits so cannot get help with this sort of thing   the staff were very impatient and wanted to close thus putting pressure on my partner to make a choice and leave  my daughter was in pieces  my partner offered to take on a payment plan in order to make the payments but they wanted payment up front before any care could be given but they also refused to give the cat back to my partner  so they had to leave the cat and my daughter was broken hearted i called the next day and spoke to a member of staff of which i do have that persons name but do not wish to disclose as i intend to make a formal complainti was advised they were going to contact a cat charity and get funding to do the necessary treatment i asked what would happen if she couldnt secure funding from the pet charities that they have contact with and she said they have a large amount of charities they can contact and that they have never had that problem  i asked why they had not called the rspca as they would pick the cat up and take it to one of their hospitals and carry out the necessary treatment  i was advised that they do not use the rspca as they find them unreliable i was also told that after funding was secured from one of the pet charities the cat would go to the charity for them to rehouse  i offered to adopt the cat and to take out pet insurance for him as i have my existing dog and cat  she said she would give me the name of the charity once she had secured funding and it would be up to them  thats all fine i thought  i called back the following day this particular member of staff was off but i was told by a nurse that xrays had been done and they had been sent off to an orthopedic surgeon i asked which charity had financially supported the care but the nurse said i needed to speak with my previous contact and she would be able to tell me  i called back today to be told by that member of staff who was rather less helpful than the last time i had spoken with her to be told that she could not divulge too much information about the cat  and that basically she couldnt get funding which she had previously advised me would not be no problem what so ever and that they were going to carry out the care themselves and then either one of the nurses or vet would keep the cat or they would rehome the cat elsewhere which in her expert opinion was the best thing for it which astounds me as i think we know the stray better than they do  and surely putting it back in its original environment is better than having to rehabilitate it to a new environment  she told me the cat was very settled and happy  however the cat is in pain and on painkillers so i have been led to believe but im not sure about that now so they are not seeing the cat in its more usual environment  eg he doesnt like doors being closed on him he likes to come and go as he pleases but likes a stroke now and again  i feel that we have been misled and that there could be another agenda going on here i cannot even express how upset my daughter is and i havent even told her about the conversation ive had with this member of staff today  i gave my daughter false hope based on a conversation with whom i thought was a caring member of staff im going to lodge a formal complaint with the md of this company following this despicable behavior but that wont take away the sense of loss and hurt we are all feeling right now,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
do not use this vet  they are more interested in taking your money than looking after your pet  me and my girlfriend have came to this vet numerous times as our cat was suffering from giardia a stomach parasite that can be fatal if not treated  we paid hundreds in vet bills to run tests on her stool samples and even more for the treatment we were quickly racking up a bill that we were struggling to fund to look after our cat our cat got better for about a month and then went back to having a constant runny bum weeping eyes and a very poorly cat once again  after going back to the vet nottingham a couple of weeks ago we were told she needs more tests run on her to find the issue once again around 200 we explained we cannot physically afford it insurance would not cover her and we were afraid and upset that we might have to get our 1yearold cat put down we were once again given some eye drops and worming treatment 76 including the consultation  as a last resort we decided to get a second opinion at the animal doctor in ravenshead never been before after getting our cat checked out they said looking over your previous history the vet nottingham hasnt actually treated your cat for giardia we could not actually believe what we were hearing the vet went on to explain the correct treatment and why she has not gotten better because our poor cat still has this nasty parasite she was given a steroid shot some antibiotics some prebiotics and some other tablets that will help her get better including the consultation this came to 88 which shows you how overpriced the vet nottingham is the vet could see how upset we were of the service we were given for our cat and even explained that we could pay at a later date to help us financially they offered to split the bill down so it was more manageable for us and were only interested in helping our cat  we will never step foot in the vet nottingham again and i advise you stay well away  they only want your money we feel we have been taken advantage of as a young couple in desperate need of help for their cat  you should all be ashamed and should not be allowed to call yourselves a vet  disgusting,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

a year ago while i was on holiday my dogs carers had to rush him to the vet morden after he had swallowed a plum the vet took xrays and said that they could see the plum seed and that they needed to operate to remove itafter cutting my dog open they realised that it was not a plum seed it was his food maybe if they had asked the question wether he had just been fed or not this could of been avoidable 15000 later and a very unhappy dog and a meeting with the vet whos excuse was it was a matter of life or death we decided not to use this vet again unfortunately a couple of weeks ago my dog became really ill and as i had moved just before lockdown and hadnt had the chance to register my dogs at another vets i reluctantly took him back to the vet mordeni explained how ill he was and how worried we were they gave me some worming treatment and told me to change his diet and to come back on monday for blood testsi took him back 2 days later for blood tests and explained how worried i was and that he was not any better they didnt give me any advise or any idea of what could be wrong with him just told to me wait for resultsi contacted another vet for a second opinion she saw me straight away and what a completely different experience it was she noticed my dog was very unwell as soon as she saw him and she gave him some pain killers and anti inflammatory meds she then referred us to the super vet fitzpatricks as she could see how much pain he was in she even called me later that evening to make sure he was okmy dog has now been diagnosed with a slipped disc and my new vet calls every now and then to make sure hes ok this sort of care would never of happened at the vet mordeni will never take another animal of mine to this vets all they are interested in is money money money and i dont believe that their prices are competitive anymore as they advertisetry another vets youll be surprised as there are vets out there that actually care about animals,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

the people who work at the surgery in ashton are so caring i cannot recommend them enough  my large american bulldogstaffie max doesnt like going to the vets at all  he is very fearful and reactive but due to some unfortunate mishaps and had to attend for treatment several times  due to her patience and kindness he has struck up a friendship with one of the nurses vicki and so she sees him every time he attends and liaises with the vets usually carlotta who understands max so well and does what is best for him not what is best for her  vicki is extremely competent professional and caring  he was attacked by another dog and had a deep wound and so i booked an appointment online  vicki called me to ask if i could take him in at a different time as she wasnt there for the original appointment and she wanted to make his visit as stressfree as possible for him  she knows he reacts to most other people in the surgery due to being frightened  he had to be sedated so that she could treat the wound and she said it would be best for my dog if i could stay with him to reassure him  she injected him after spending 20 minutes with him settling him down then put blankets down on the floor and left just him and i in the room for him to relax and go to sleep  she treated the deep wound and then allowed me to stay with him until he came round  she was taking leave for a week and said to send pictures or a video to the vets instead of bringing him in as it would be stressful for him if she wasnt there which the vet agreed with  she also said that if he had to come back with any complications whilst she was away that the surgery should call her and she would pop in and settle him  how cool is that  i forgot to take his medication away with me and so had to go back next day  i took max in as it was quiet and carlotta came out to see how his was from a distance even though she had clients booked in  just amazing,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

had the most horrendous experience after a vet perforated my dogs eardrum during routine examination eventually resulting in him having his ear canal removed when making a complaint i was told i had no evidence and because id asked the vet to look in my dogs ear they tried to state he had a pre existing condition i had only taken him that day as hed had some dental work and this was a check up i mentioned i noticed he was shaking his head the day before so could she give him a check over during the examination i was told no damageperforation to my dogs ear i have to say i left feeling upset that day and spoke about it to the receptionist on my way out the vet had asked me to help her hold my dog down as he was screaming after she inserted instruments and a cotton bud in his ear hes a pug and very tolerant usually so was worried she had really hurt him she administered some drops incase of any infection which i gave that night and the next morning the next day i found my dog lying in vomit  diarreah he couldnt walk and his head was at a tilt i thought he had had a stroke i rushed back to the vets where i was told his eardrum was perforated right in the middle this was where the vet had inserted a cotton bud the ear drops had entered his middle ear and had caused him to be off balance i spoke to the manager about this and she advised me to get back in touch when everything had resolved my dog had treatment for months but we could see the deterioration during this time i had to chase for results for more medication nobody returned my calls and on one occasion i was told by a vet in her experience she had never seen a dog recover from similar issues and to prepare myself to put him out of his misery after a particularly bad experience of seeing my dogs head fill with an abscess and double in size we made the decision to have his ear canal removed my dog is obviously now deaf he walks off balance with a head tilt its just devastating i have had no apology or offer of help with the 10k cost i used this vets since they opened in 2016 so absolutely devastated with their response i will not be taken my pets their again,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

my son took his guinea pig in to the vet  nottingham yesterday evening he was pretty ill and needed to be put to sleep there was a few issues which ill list below  1 my son told the receptionist that the guinea was pretty ill and he thought he wasnt going to last long they kept him waiting for about 25 minutes before seeing him and the guinea was in a lot of pain on a sign in the surgery it says emergencies and euthanasia are prioritised this wasnt the case yesterday  2the vet my son saw was ignorant he wasnt listening when my son told him he has been giving him meds he asked my son if he had been giving him meds when he just told him he had the vet seemed to have little knowledge in regards to guinea pigs and was only picking up on things that my son pointed out the vet then decided to explain to my son who was already upset about the guinea about how they put them to sleep there was zero reason for him to do this as my son didnt ask and none of the other vets explained it to him my son also ticked the paper so he could get a fur clipping the vet didnt do it i understand that guinea pigs are hard to fathom out sometimes and its hard to know whats wrong with them but if a vet isnt 100 sure then perhaps they ought not to treat them and yes this is an accurate account of what happened when my son went to see the vet no one but my son the vet and the guinea pig were at that appointment  ive never been very happy with this particular vet the only animal of ours that they knew how to treat properly was our dog weve lost so many guinea pigs due to the lack of guinea pig knowledge  i havent made a complaint to the surgery because the business manager not sure if its the same person now more or less told me not to go there anymore unless its an emergency i do have other things id like to say about this person but for the time being ill leave them out of my review im looking into make a formal complaint to the rvc  there were a couple of women in the waiting room who were also speaking badly about the same vet that isnt my sons fault that is their opinion but sadly for the surgery other people heard what was said  ps  i had a call from the vet surgery that storm was originally with they told me that someone from the vet had called this morning to ask for storms medical records and wanted my permission to pass them on i asked why and explained storm had been put to sleep yesterday she said she didnt know and agreed with me when i said i didnt want to give his records to them  my son will be contacting the vet so they can remove us from their register we wont be going back to the surgery ever again not in an emergency or anything else,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

my visits over the past 4 years to the vet in southampton have always been good  they saved my cats life when she accidentally ingested rat poison the vets have always been friendly and their advice has always been great until today sitting in reception waiting for my cat to have her annual boosters i hear the receptionist speaking to numerous clients on the phone about flea treatments i hear her telling one client well you can get something from a shop but it isnt very strong chemically so you can come and make an appointment with us and get something thats better and stronger and a second one is told from a shop it only works a couple of times and after that because there are no chemicals it just doesnt work anymore this is incorrect and as a pet store manager in the industry for 15 years and an sqp for the last 10 years is misinformation im sadly all too used to hearing when i got in to see the vet i asked him if the receptionists were sqp trained to be giving this advice to clients as i was concerned more people are being told the wrong thing and worrying about what they are using on their pet he did not answer this and instead started to argue with me about products such as frontline and bob martin he said that bob martin kills cats and that frontline does not work anymore and should only be used on very young kittens as they dont need the product to be that strong i told him that it does and if it did not work then surely it shouldnt be sold anymore he said that the bugs have all developed resistance and compared these products to antibiotic resistance i asked about seresto a product which vets have rated and recommended for years and now due to further proven safety has been recently changed so that sqps in pet stores can now sell it and he said the same thing about the resistance to the ingredients the majority of the time products not working as expected is due to user error  either 1 the product was appliedadministered incorrectly or for the wrong weight of animal 2 not all animals in the home were treated 3 the biggest one  the environment was not treated  only the animals i would suggest that as the face of your business your receptionists receive some correct training on these products  especially during high demand in this warmer weather and also that your vet ines ilic receives firstly some customer service training on how not to be rude and argue with a client secondly how to handle a cat that is nervous and how to show any shred of care towards her and thirdly to do his research so that he is not scaremongering clients who will always trust their vets and also to ensure that he  and yourselves  do not end up subject to a court case for slander by these companies he is slating,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

our dog had gone lame on one leg and we were sent away with anti inflammatories and rest and if not x rays of the hips and stifle would be needed as noted in his medical notes we were giving the cost for this of 380 a few days later peanut deteriorated again so we booked in for the x rays when i handed him over there was converation about the price and it may be more if they need to x ray elsewhere i agreed to this and said the hips and stifles will need doing so we can be sure what the problem is i also said i wasnt 100 happy with him being put under a general anesthetic and asked for possible sedation  this was at 805am in the morning it then got to nearly 6pm and i was worried sick so had to call them myself several times before finally getting through and i could go and collect him when i arrived payment was taking and i sat and waited to be called in when i collected him i asked for the outcome but there was no vet available to speak to or look at the x rays they couldnt even tell me what they had x rayed i left with a dog non weight bearing on his leg 380 poorer and no explanation i then had to wait till 3pm the following day for a vet to call me and they didnt x ray his stifles at this point i was fuming as our dog is a risky breed to be going under again we returned the following day and saw another vet which we had to pay for so another consultation fee and medication and he was unable to tell us what was wrong with our dog without being sent for an mri scan thankfully 4 weeks on our dog is back to normal and must of been something minor in the end also dont bother complaining as they call your dog by the wrong name and basically call you a lair regarding any conversations you have has with the vets there if you go make sure you write everything down and get them to sign it although you shouldnt have to when you are paying good money for a service would just like to add the staff on reception are lovely when we returned to see the vet again there was nearly a two hour wait and we had children with us they kindly got us hot drinks for the wait,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

been to this vet in morden a few times some days are really good and helpful and some days are not there is quite a few young staff and receptionists that are quite rude receptionist always huffing and puffing as if its too much for them to work and i get it working in a vet is a stressful environment but its not the customer fault we also are worried and anxious too with our pets so when we come out from the rooms and walk back to the front desk the customers shouldnt have to deal with the rudeness i think a course or staff training needs to be put in to effect as the receptionists need to be more happy to help customers for instance a vet nurse came out to the front to report to the receptionist about my appointment and the receptionist could not be bothered to respond and sighed again when you leave the vets youre deflated thinking why were they so moody with me and what did i do wrong  there was a receptionist called katie who i havent seen in some time in my recent visits she is so rude and horribly spoken i do not know how or why she was allowed to be on the front desk she even made racist remarks to pakistani people  this is supposed to a helpful place passion for animals and i believe the veterinary staff do have this but at times even the student vets cannot be bothered there was even a mix up one time with my pet and they did apologized and said they mixed my pet up with another pet  i just wish the front desk staff would perk up a bit and give people a smile as soon as the customers walk through the front door  a vet even made a big mistake with my friends dog said he broke his foot so she got a second opinion from another vet and it turned out to be a bruise what a big mistake to make so glad my friend got a second opinion otherwise she would of have to payed 500 which the vet told my friend how much it would cost to have her dogs foot repaired  this is also supposed to be a lower price vet clinic than others and it really is not they overcharge on prescriptions and sometimes you cant pay in full as alot of people who attend this vet are on a low income or have struggles and therefore set up a payment plan as i witness a guy do so but they do not like it when you havent got alot of money or pay up front debs the older receptionist was rude to a customer after she mentioned paying half and half the day after and raised her voice and said surely you can pay more than that and katie at the time was sitting next to debs and rolled her eyes  horrible,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i have quite a long history with the vets well over 1 year ago i had to treat one of my rats and medication prescribed was calculated incorrectly i ignored that as i can rectify that issue myself changed the vet for some time and eventually came back had some successful visits reception team is amazing and very supportive they try to make sure the appointment time suits your personal arrangements and in general are just the most friendly girls i have ever met in different vet practices sadly visiting vets is not about that  i already left one review here to that i actually received a response and i was asked to contact them via email which i did i described all issues in more details that i wanted to rectify however my email was ignored i even emailed again a week ago just to remind adam that is the person who asked me to email the vet that i am still waiting none of my emails were aggressive so i am unsure as to why it was left completely ignored  i absolutely understand that rats are very tricky however my experience with the vet was overall positive so it just upsets me that 2 visits in a row ended up so badly  the first one out of two visits ended up with the vet erik telling me that my clearly ill rat is perfectly fine one week later that rat was put to sleep and i believe that with accurate medication that i am always happy to pay for he could have a few extra weeks with us eriks attitude towards me was not nice but i hope he just had a bad day  it was the second time i have seen him and the first visit was good so i was very surprised to see him disputing every single thing i say example i gave him a syringe with a sample of my rats urine with blood in it clearly red he asked me how do i know he is peeing blood i mean seriously that rat was showing very obvious syptoms of neurological problems  pt unable to hold anything with front paws wobbly losing appetite also showing signs of being in pain  constantly closed eyes ached back puffed fur we left with no medication whatsoever he did prescribe some medication for my other rat  he first offered doxycycline and once i said that i actually have it at home he changed it to trimethoprim  im glad we dont live in a cartoon because i swear he would have dollar signs in his eyes   as for the second visit ive seen iona  she straight away stated that she is not a vet specializing in rats and recommended to go to a completely different practice why waste my time then i always say what pet i am bringing with me so that was something that did concern me on that visit i was putting my rat to sleep the one erik saw before and i asked for medication for my other old rat that is the one peeing blood that erik saw before as well medication from him worked for a few days but my rat didnt take full dose as it was incredibly bitter so i asked for a different one i was told by iona there is none wrong there is baytril but i can give him inflacam i know well enough that inflacam without an antibiotic is pointless not to mention that she actually didnt prescribe it she prescribed some baytril for nebusiler to treat his lungs but in my eyes blood in urine is way more urgent she also advised me to get iv saline solution which i cant get from local pharmacies without a prescription i also gave her a sample of my rats urine to see what is wrong but she did not test it i since took my rats elsewhere and the issue with the blood in urine was fixed within 2 weeks  such a shame because i really liked visiting the vets and i enjoyed little chats with lovely girls in the reception,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

id like to share our experience with the vet hengrove as a word of warning to anyone considering joining this practice we joined last year after adopting our rescue puppy vida as it was a bit cheaper than the local vets so we thought we would register her there a few months later vida was struck by a car whilst out on a walk luckily she ran into the side of it rather than going under it we rushed her to an emergency vet where they looked after her and after a few hours we took her home and monitored her overnight the next morning we took her to the vet hengrove where she was examined by one of the vets we were worried that she had broken her front right leg as she was limping on it quite badly the vet examined her swollen leg and told us that she thought it wasnt broken we were surprised but also relieved to hear this at no point did she ask for a second opinion or suggest xrays in fact i asked her if it was worth getting xrays which she said you can but i dont think its necessary it doesnt feel broken given we had only taken out insurance that week we were not covered for any of this and given the hundreds of pounds it costs and the words of reassurance from the vet we decided not to the dog was clearly limping but was also using the leg the vet told us not to stop her from using the leg so thats what we did we let her use the leg and after a week the swelling had gone down and we could see there was something very wrong there was a big bump in her leg where the bones were clearly broken we took her back to the vets where they took xrays and confirmed it was broken but by this point she had been running around the house on the vets advise for a week eventually after feeling like we were being let down we spoke to the head vet sophie she explained that the vet we saw didnt think it was broken and she had the dogs best interest at heart ive no doubt thats the truth but we relied on them as the experts to make the correct assessment and if there was any doubt in her mind then she should have suggested we have the leg xrayed sophie was unprepared to take any responsibility for the mistakes her team had made  at this point we just wanted to fix the situation as best we could as the leg was healing wonky this involved them putting her leg in a splint for several weeks which ended up rubbing all the fur off her leg and cutting deep into her flesh eventually they stopped putting her leg in a splint we then spent several hundreds of pounds on further xrays and scans to find out the severity of the problem and weather it would require surgery after an inconclusive diagnosis we had to wait a further few months pay hundreds of pounds more for further scans and await the results of that the entire time we felt like we were being sent from pillar to post seeing different vets each time without ever seeing a specialist  during this time there were several issues with them not contacting me when they said they would with results i would eventually phone back and would be told on numerous occasions that they had left me a message when they had not after a while i asked them to read back the numbers they had and they had 3 phone numbers mine my girlfriends and a completely random number nothing to do with us that they had clearly been leaving messages on for weeks sometimes the xrays would be late and rather than informing us we would have to phone them i began to find the level of incompetence frustrating and inexcusable after spending thousands of pounds we were told that the dog wouldnt need surgery and could live with the now reformed bent leg after this we began to notice the leg was continuing to bow so took her to another vet for a second opinion they were clear just from looking at it that it would require surgery and we were referred to highcroft referrals vida ended up having to have a very serious and extremely expensive operation where her leg had to be rebroken and a metal plate four inches long screwed into her bone following this was 8 weeks of having to look after a dog with a broken leg both of us sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the living room as the dog had to be crate bound or on a leash in a room without furniture so she couldnt run or jump even days before her surgery despite several attempts from highcroft to retrieve her xrays from the vet noone ever sent them over we had photos of them on our phone that we had to provide the surgeon how ridiculous  the toll this took on us emotionally and financially was great we had to take time off work we had to deal with all the stresses and upset of months of seeing our dog in pain and discomfort as well as the total bill after surgery scans and appointments coming in at 8000 all of this could and should have been avoided if the original vet hadnt misdiagnosed her injury the stream of further mistakes makes the whole thing inexcusable we have been left to feel very upset and angry about the situation our focus since has been on the dog thankfully she is now fit and well again and we have her registered at highcroft who have been fantastic now that we have dealt with the immediate situation we are looking into taking legal action against the vet to cover the financial costs involved as it stands we havent even had an apology,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

the vets  southampton  our first experience was getting our cat harveys first vaccination we were told this was the best thing and was not told about any risks he developed a small lump so we took him straight back to get checked out the vet told us that it could be cancer and he should have his next vaccine but not to worry worse case scenario theyd inject him in his tail and if he developed a cancerous lump they would just chop it off  during a routine check up for our cat loma i told the vet that loma was not neutered as we were hoping she would get pregnant she looked at me with disgust raised her eyebrows and tutted at me and shook her head i explained to her that we had a plan and that we already had homes for her kittens with family members loma got pregnant much to our delight and we bought lots of kitten toys however one morning when she was heavily pregnant she had bleed and i took her straight to the vets i was told she would be seen immediately  but i had to go to the reception after 10 minutes to remind her of this promise and that my cat was bleeding the vet was the same one who i saw previously and i felt immediately a look of told you so she did an ultrasound during which a vet assistant called hope helped me hold loma hope was lovely and really calmed loma and myself she was very kind and i am so grateful that she was there the vet struggled to find kittens saying that they were really small she told me that there were 2 kittens one had a faint heart beat the other none she had to get the head vet in to double check and this vet did not talk to me about anything she saw and left immediately after looking at the scan the vet said the best thing was a c section and to be neutered i felt so presured and rushed by the vet she was saying it was the best thing and she would get infections i agreed and im now going to have to live with that guilt forever that she will never be able to have her own kittens she was filling out a form and asked had she ate and i said yes and she sighed and shook her head at the time in my painc and upset i apologised  how on earth should i have known this would happen she said that she could choke on her vomit and die in the operation so i asked her to wait a few hours before going ahead she said they would do their best for loma and her kittens i got a phone call later saying that loma was okay and that unfortunately they could not resusate her one kitten and it died i was distraught and relived that loma was okay when i arrived i saw a vet i had never seen she was very happy considering the sadness of the situation and she had no idea about what operation loma had she looked very surprised when i asked her about the kitten she had to go and ask the vet she asked if i wanted to take home the kitten and i said yes she came back with hope we named her kitten after the lovely vet assistant wrapped in an old towel and i asked can you put it in a box so she went off and came back with the towel squashed into a broken old glove box and said sorry thats all we have the towel was covered in thick black hair a dogs hair this vet gave me no information on how to care for loma i was only given a piece of paper about neutered cats thankfully i sought a different vets who went through all the infections and signs i should be looking out for before this though i reluctantly returned for her check up and was told by the male receptionist that i could not see the vet as i had no apointment when i said isnt it a non appointment vets he said its all on the website and i was dismissed the day of loosing the kitten was a very upsetting day and was awful however i do feel this was made so much worse from the vets i am upset and angry that i was rushed and given the impression that neutering was the only option for our cat that we have since been told that this was not required we will not be returning to the vets and i will be telling my family and friends to avoid this vets,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

melbourne  mercia vets cannock i wouldnt recommend this practice to anyone theyre ok for minor stuff but my dog had to have an operation when i went to collect him i was told the wound had been seeping and itd had to be dressed he was fitted with a buster collar to stop him getting to the wound i stayed downstairs with him the following night i went to bed as he was fine in himself i came down on the sunday morning to find the buster collar had come apart although it was still attached to his collar it was flapping open i saw blood on the floor when i looked hed got to the wound and 2 stitches were out we went immediately to an emergency vet as soon as we walked in the nurse said the buster collar was to small for him and very flimsy he was examined by the vet who said hed be ok till the next morning but to take him back to our vet as the stitches needed to be replaced it resulted in another anesthetic to put it right when i questioned the bill as the further proceedure was due to the wrong sized collar they started to trying lay the blame on me i contacted head office and lodged an official complaint i recieved a refund for the original operation but i wouldve prefered that they had got the initial after care right so my boy didnt have to endure 2 anesthetics which resulted in a much longer recuperation needless to say i changed vets my experience with this practice was way below whats expected the attidude from them when i questioned the care was closed ranksdesperately trying to shift blame what shouldve been a routine simple operation turned into an ordeal for my dog and very expensive for me i personally wouldnt ever take either of my dogs back there,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

fantastic vets my 11 year old staffie cross had a large skin tag on her hind leg that got to a point where it needed removing  there was another large lump on the other hind leg i asked for that to be removed at the same time i also wanted her teeth cleaned i had been informed by my previous vet practice that they would not do this her teeth clean would cost in the region of 500 then she would need to be put back under for the lump removal again costing roughly 500 i was very apprehensive about having to put her under due to her age the vet offered to do her preblood work there  then to save time  stress for me so if there was anything wrong it could be addressed prior to her coming in for the op on the day of the op plenty of time was taken with me to reassure me i was called to advise that she had been fine  that she had just been put under and it was discovered she needed 4 extractions and that there would be additional cost if it was ok with me i was later called to advise she was out and she was recovering well practically up and walking straight away when i collected her that evening again plenty of time was spent with me to talk me through what happened and the aftercare required 2 lump removals  4 extraction cost 580 2 post op checks included my previous vet had her on antibiotics for the large lump and would charge us a consultation fee each time they wanted us back at the end of the course of antibiotics  only for them to put her on more it was a seemingly never ending circle  which is why i left them and now travel from harlow  i have dealt with 3 different vets and 1 nurse each very friendly with the patience of a saint the girls on reception are fantastic aswell  i recommend this vets and other branches to friends as i find the care amazing the price is very good aswell,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

saw a just qualified vet they had to get confirmation on what she was prescribing to my dog and wasnt strong enough to be making the decisions would have been better if she was being chaperoned i took my dog to the vets with having diarrhoea they gave me liquid wormer which was very hard to get down him and after googling the medication can also cause loose bowels also gave me a probiotic which can also cause loose bowels then told me if he is still having loose bowels to bring him back in three days as it will cost a lot of money to sort him out i want to know why would they prescribe medication that can cause diarrhoea to a dog that already has it the vet nottingham shauna holmes,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i had an email from the vet this morning asking to review my latest visit so here goes my dog has been registered here since she was a puppy and id always been happy with the care and cost of consultations treatment etc though lately prices have shot up and i havent been all too happy with the last few visits the most recent being i had concerns about her bladder which a vet prescribed her medication for as she thought she may have a weak bladder but didnt tell me anything about the medication such as side effects or even the cost i couldnt believe it when i went to reception to pay and a small bottle that would last only 10 days cost me over 40 i got home and researched the said medication online to find horrendous side effects and also found it to cost far less for a much larger bottle there was no way i was going to give my dog a potentially lethal medication when the vet wasnt even 100 certain that she had a weak bladder in the first place i emailed the vets to politely ask if there was an alternative cheaper and less risky medication to try instead and if i could return the unopened medication for a refund i was told that a vet would call me the very next day to discuss further options but told they wouldnt be able to refund me for the medication which i wasnt going to use and still havent used the next day i made sure to have my phone with me at every possible opportunity and no one rang in fact i didnt get a phone call until 10 days later which i missed and had a very pointless voicemail left im now down over 40 for a bottle of medication i will never use oh and to top it all off my dog doesnt even have a weak bladder after all so im  extremely glad i didnt give her the medication,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

where do i begin after my pregnant cat went missing for two days and then came home bleeding regularly we rushed her to the vet in ashton normally we use another vet but decided to give them a try we arrived at 1815 on 2202 when we got back to see the vet he seemed very concerned about the fact that they were closing soon he gave our cat a quick look over and then said there was nothing he could do that night as he didnt have time he gave her an injection of antibiotic and told us to make an appointment for the morning while on reception paying for the visit and booking for the morning the vet came out and said to the receptionist that he had to leave and she was upset that he was not finishing with the other customers still in the shop we were then told to just show up at 8 instead of making an appointment  when i showed up at 8 the following morning i waited an hour to see the vet watching 2 customers who showed up after me get served first when i got into see the vet she told me that she thought that the pregnancy had gone wrong and that we would need to spay her or put her down then gave me a long list of other potential fatal things that could be a factor i opted for the surgery and left my cat with the vet  i received a call at 1242 that afternoon informing me that when they tried to administer anisthetic that my cat had taken a turn for the worse i was told that after doing emergency blood work which i had agreed to if necessary that her blood levels were not good and they could not do the surgery i was told that she most likely had a viral blood infection and the chance of her survival was very unlikely and that the only alternative was blood transfusion that would cost thousands and would only have a very slim chance of helping  i informed the vet that i would like to know the costs and options as i was not willing to put her down the vet infomed me that she would phone some specialists and get back to me within the hour as time was critical i was in harrogate with work at this time which is two hours away from the ashton store i left immediately and picked up my partner from work as she was in pieces having heard the news that we would most likely be putting our cat to sleep  when we arrived at the vet we told the receptionist who we were and he said he would inform the vet this was at 1600 and i still hadnt received the call that i was told i would get one hour from when we initially spoke we were left waiting for roughly an hour at which point i asked the receptionist what was going on and he informed me the vet was making the calls to the specialists and would be with us soon clearly she had not made any calls until we showed up to find out what was going on after being told time was critical i find this unacceptable finally we spoke with the vet who said after speaking to a few specialists that the surgery was now completely possible and that it was unlikely that all the other fatal possibilities i was told were likely were a factor we asked to see her as we at this point believed she was on the verge of death due to the vets description when they brought her out she was awake alert and seemingly in relatively good shape nowhere near the cat fighting for her life we were lead to believe  unfortunately now that so much time had passed she would need to be taken to an after hours clinic for the surgery i was initially quoted 100 for the surgery and had already paid 27 the night before i was given a bill for 130 and was told it was because they had to do a blood test so now im 150 in and still have nothing to show for it this is already more than the cost quoted for the problem to be solved  we were told to go straight to the after hours vet only up the road so we headed straight there this was about 1800 they told us they had not yet received the email with all the information from the vet which i was told was being sent as i was leaving i had to ring and remind the receptionist that he needed to send the email as we were leaving the receptionist explained that they are a vet during the day and a separate company operate after hours so we would have to pay the normal rate for them to care for her until 1900 we had already dropped her off so were charged a further 22 they informed us that they had told the vet we could avoid this fee if we just came at 1900 this was never conveyed to us i was completely embarrassed as i was under the impression we were only dropping our cat off and the receptionist had to stop us at the door and tell us we couldnt leave without paying we were also not told we would have to leave a deposit of 200 we were then quoted 6001000 for the procedure as it was out of hours this was only necessary due to the fact that the initial vet did not have the knowledge to perform the procedure correctly  the surgery was performed overnight by pets999 who were very attentative and kept me informed the whole time they said there was no reason why the surgery would not be successful and were confident she would be fine  the surgery went fine and there were no complications she is now home and recovering thanks to pets999 and no thanks to and in spite of the complete lack of competency of the vet  myself and my partner have been put through complete hell the last 48 hours after being made to believe there was no hope for our beloved cat actually being advised to put her down and then having to pay astronomical prices of over 800 for out of hours urgent care that wouldnt have been necessary if the vet had a more experienced competent staff  i never once felt like anyone at the vet cared for my cats welfare or our emotional state i was charged more than i was quoted for something that wasnt even done and got left with a huge bill  i am now wondering how to pay my bills and i will never use or recommend the vet to anyone we were referred by friends and will be letting all of them know of our

my dogs certainly prefer the open plan environment of the vet practice and ive received only good service so far the only negative i feel is that with my dog being very nervous ex cruelty case although the vet was nice and thorough she wasnt confident in working with such a nervous animal and did approach her in a way that i discourage members of the public from doing which historically has caused a reaction from her maybe she hasnt any experience in nervous dogs so likely just a training issue other than that ive had no issues and will definately use the practice in the future over previous practices,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

sadly our experience is not was not good when our dog went in for a routine castration operation which he should have been recovered from within 2 days he was he was extremely unwell and would not drink and when we took him out he would not walk when we took him back they wanted to charge us another 18000 which we could not afford i instead gave he water by syringe he had antibiotics he took nearly 3 weeks to recover he was a perfect healthy dog when he went in i believe he was discharged way to early as i had to carry him out and there excuse was he was bruised i also felt they should realised he was not right before they released him after all they are supposed to be the qualified vets i will not be using for again,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
the day we took our cat samson to the vet he was really poorly he had not been eating properly for a while and was losing weight we were getting worried as hes an old boy our wait was a little longer than is typical but it was spent talking to other visitors so went by quite quickly eventually it was our turn the vet gave him a thorough examination after i had explained samsons problems he diagnosed the cause straight away and treated him with a steroid injection he explained that he could need further treatment if the injection did not work but that this was the best course of action to take first we are pleased to say the injection did the trick samson is back to his old self eating well and putting on weight all thanks to the vet we are happy to give the vet a 5 star a1 rating  mrmrs t moulton,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
the treatment our two cats get at the vet is very good the facilities are very clean spacious and full of light every member of staff is more than nice from receptionist to the vets themselves the reason for the 3 stars is the fact that every visit to this vet means at least a 30  45 minute wait why because they are adamant in not having a booking system so no matter at what time or what day you go you can always expect a long wait i think the managers should realise that this is not an nhs for animals this is privately funded by us and we do not want to wait 45 minutes for our pets to be seen if they could improve that they would definitively get my 5 stars,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

usually we have a very positive and professional experience at the vet however this time i am not able to say that my cat was given advocate  inappropriately resulting in him being able to lick it off and the next day he had issues with mobility in his back legs falling over when he tried to walk i had to keep him inside until this wore off it was very frightening and upsetting to see him like this my daughter did not ask the nurse to apply advocate we are very capable of doing this ourselves she did this without asking and i was then charged 9 for her doing so the waiting time was over 2hrs and when my daughter asked when she would be seen she was told that she was next then two others were allowed to be seen before her all in all very disappointing and unprofessional i have to say that when i complained the manager was very understanding and refunded  the amount charged for putting advocate on my cat offered a free consultation with a vet to check if our cat was ok and investigated  the incident i have been assured this will not happen again and i am willing to give the vet  another chance,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0]"

i have taken my two kittens to the vet twice now for their jabs they have to have two each the first time we registered and did have to wait a while approx 2 hours to see a vet because it was their first visit and first jabs we did not mind waiting lots of cute dogs and cats to keep you entertained also rather than having to make appointments we prefer to wait because our kittens can be difficult to get into their carry cases so wouldnt want to make an appointment and then have to cancel because of this this way is much more flexible the second visit we only waited 20 minutes because their jabs were with the nurse i have so far found all the reception staff to be very pleasant and friendly dealing well with issues and complaints overheard not complaints from me and answering queries over the phone with good knowledge the vet and nurse we saw were both really friendly good with the kittens who were very nervous and offered us good advice on how to help them be more confident tomorrow they go in for their neutering which i am nervous about but the staff have been reassuring and i am very pleased so far,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

not very pleasant experience unfortunately as my kitten was once hurt when she had her fur shaved off so close to the skin under the neck for a blood test and she came home with a wound and a scar has been left since still not healed and i am not ready to take her back for another blood test the medicines are very expensive and the same ones are available on some websites for less than half the prices it is very difficult to get through to them by phones and sometimes your line gets cut off while waiting to speak to someone for so long the only plus side is that you can get to see the vet without an appointment but you will have to wait patiently for a while to be seen as it is a walkin clinic so they are always busy but they have a pretty clean and spacious waiting area and the parking is free so this is also a good point,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i joined this vet based on reading reviews online and the fact they offered good opening hours and competitive pricing i bought the puppy package my rating is due to the fact that the vet did not pick up on my puppys ear infection on his first health check this was  as commented on by another vet an obvious infection and the smell was very bad even when i went back a week later as the smell was getting worse and i could see my puppy was in pain the vet  who was a different vet to the first one i saw  commented they couldnt smell anything shockingly bad i had to push to get his ears tested which showed a bad ear infection i raised a complaint which was eventually responded to i was given wrong information about what was included in the puppy packages the vets i saw seem inexperienced and poor no one seemed to know what treatment my puppy should be given and when please dont join this vet if you care for your pet join a vet where they care and spend time listening to you and also consistency of vet cheap deals arent worth youre pets health if you care about them  awful practice,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

my guinea pig had what was assumed to be a mammary tumour and so i took him to the vet because it is far far cheaper than any other vet in nottingham and the walk in service is extremely convenient ultimately he ended up having an operation to remove it guinea pigs and operations do not mix well however they did a brilliant job and were very caring and experienced follow up appointments were included in the very cheap price for the operation and i now wouldnt hesitate to have another guinea pig operated on  the other week i took my other guinea pig this time the vet was not so experienced with pigs which meant that a referral was necessary for any further diagnosis however she throughly checked every inch of my pig to check his health not to mention how much she clearly liked animals  to conclude the vet is an excellent option for poorly guinea pigs but some vets are more experienced than others and unfortunately it is a lucky dip  i would never go anywhere else,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

ive used my local veterinary surgery for 30 years and have sort of been happy with the service received ive sometimes drifted away and used the services of other local vets and always went back to my usual vet mainly out of convenience then i discovered the vet on glaisdale drive nottingham not too far away from where i live so i recently gave them a try no appointment required  just walk in  brilliant the waiting area is split in to 2 halves one for cats and the other for dogs the experience from receptionist to seeing a vet was a lot less stressful for my dog and very quick in comparison with our usual veterinary surgery where an appointment needs to be made which is rarely made for that day this isnt always convenient and then more often than not on the day of the appointment a long wait ensues in their waiting area not good for our animals   its a given fact that vets bills can be a little on the pricey side even just for a check up this may discourage some from taking a sick animal to a vet however the fees that the vet charge are honest  value for money their service is second to none with your animals welfare being their priority good honest medical care at an affordable price for our animals at last  i would definitely recommend this surgery  give them a try and see for yourself your animal companion deserves it,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

so far we have visited this vet twice with our kitten and on both occasions despite booking in at reception they have forgotten us from the list on the first occasion we patiently waited 15hrs thinking it was busy and they were short staffed when we eventually questioned reception we were told that they had called us but we didnt answer both my partner and i know for a fact this was not the case but receptionist was very defensive we eventually got seen and put it behind us as thinking it was just a bad day and a sad kitten being boxed in for so long however on our 2nd visit 4 weeks later history repeated itself this time we had been waiting an hour not thinking it would happen again but sure enough we approached reception only to be told that the other receptionist who had checked us in had put us on the wrong list by accident the receptionist was not apologetic whatsoever and had a bad attitude 10 minutes later we were seen they should invest in a screen system to see when you are next or at least have your name appear when its your turn definately left a negative feeling for us even an apology would have been something now considering looking elsewhere and paying the extra for a better service,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

my cat is now 3 years old and had gotten her second uti i swear i am not a bad parent her sister never gets these and i guess she is just prone to them the first two times were extremely stressful because i had to keep her overnight at the local vets because they were not able to extract the urine each time it was around 200400 it ended up coming back 4 months later because i had switched her food up regardless my anxiety spiked knowing i would have to take her through all of that and decided to try dutch instead i was able to obtain a vet appointment on a sunday at 6pm which i just signed up 3 hours prior when normally all vets are closed and booked up i explained to her my cats symptoms and within minutes she prescribed me the same medicine my local vet did i paid for overnight shipping so it came out to 60 this was all way cheaper and quicker and it allowed my cat to not be stressed through the process im so happy i found dutch it is like a virtual care for pets and its so modern and easy i was nervous at first but i am writing this to say definitely use dutch and skip the hassle and extra money sent by going to a local vet i did call my original vet the next day to say the exact same thing and what do you knowshe said she has to be taken in and get her urine extracted so it was exactly what i thought it would be and i am glad my instincts were right thank you dutch,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

recently california 1124 revised the law and allows telehealth for animals including prescribing medications  this is excellent news   we care for our animals like family there is a shortage of vets in certain parts of the state more than others  this is progress  however it is one step forward one giant step backwards with dutch  on the eve of july 3rd i was told by my doggy day care that my puppy had puppy warts or pappalivirus and he was quarantined and cannot return until he comes back  my vet an animal hospital though closed early for the day and was closed for the holiday all the way through the hospital  as an aside no hospital should be called such that closes for 4 days i thought i have options and used dutch    i was prepared of course for it to be harder than it looks as one cannot just sign up for a one time visit one must become a member  fine  i paid the membership fee and booked a visit for 910 am on the 4th   for some reason they tell you to plan for 30 minutes  you get 10 minutes if youre lucky  the vet joined 2 minutes late and ended 2 minutes early was not friendly engaging empathetic or even interested  instead i got a prescription for antiinflammatory which i told her in the call i needed transferred to costco   she said nothing in response    costco was closed the 4th so i sent several messages through the chat system with the phone number of the costco and planned to pick up on the 5th   when i go to check on the status i dont even see my message recorded  i call the phone number  no one answers  i leave more messages nothing  i notice a box on the website that says order your medications which i was ignoring because in the united states of america prescriptions do not have to be filled by a specific pharmacy although often one does for insurance benefits but prescriptions transfer  ask anyone who has had their eyes examined  optometrists everywhere fought this one hard but there is a very good reason your eye doctor is not an employee of your eye glass store  they still have their tactics but prescriptions are required to be given without a request for transfer before one even asks  this is not the case at dutchcom  no there is a separate form one must complete an additional 5 fee and 24 day processing time   how ridiculous  this is pain medication i am not ordering  from an online pharmacy and waiting for shipping for pain medicine  this is the most perfect example of a company that puts profits before animals   prescriptions should be called in to any pharmacy requested for same day fill if possible without a fee  not doing so undermines the entire ca law which is intended to expand access to care and not delay suffering   my complaint is that the fee was not disclosed clearly enough and the delay was not mentioned and it is just a bad faith practice that is evidence that this company does not have the best interest of animals as their mission and by doing so will not thrive  companies that seek to undermine progress made by new laws by intentionally increasing delays when the law was intended to reduce the delays are not companies that last  certainly not in california where consumer protection comes first   my ask of dutch is to do the right thing before more laws and fines are implemented against your company  doing business in california is a privilege not a right  i made a second appointment with a vet who i quote told me he was breaking the rules by calling it in himself but did it  how sad is that dutch  a vet had to break the rules to do the right thing for an animal who was suffering  he deserves an award a raise and not admonishment   answer your messages your phones  eliminate transfer fees build 2 mins into the  visit to call a script in  run a respectable business for animals that puts their welfare first or find a new business,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i had an urgent situation with my dog who was experiencing panic attacks at night for about eight consecutive nights leaving both of us without sleep i reached out to dutch and got a membership to benefit from their quick response time for vet appointments they connected me to a vet within 50 minutes we received a prescription and the vet understood the urgency of the situation  however their website is poorly designed requiring several unusual steps to find tracking information they falsely advertise that medications will be delivered in one day after rx approval which is absolutely incorrect beware if you want to get the urgent shipping it will cost you 75 and who knows when you actually receive it to your door  now five days have passed since i placed my order and i still have no tracking information i discovered that their policy is to ship the medication in one day after approval but this is false advisement as you can have the reference from my experience my medication isnt even in transit yet once the package is accepted by the carrier it takes another 57 or more days to arrive  imagine being in an urgent situation and relying on these guys who promise help but fail to deliver that while you hopelessly wait for a possible solutions i am canceling my membership and writing more reviews to inform others about this misleading service  update correct that the manager reached out to me however still a false information again and again they promised me when i was ordering the regular shipping it was stating as ill receive it on thursday which was within 4 days of my order technically and nothing arrived nothing even has been shipped no tracking information yet though they promised that it will arrive yesterdaywithin 4 days oh one more thing is that this was already making me upset that it will arrive in 4 days since their first advisement is promising within one day manager is still giving a false information in here beware because they offered at the check out as 75 extra for an over night shipping at the end if i knew this would happen i would only use the vet service that dutch was offering and that was very prompt and i appreciate it but i think you guys need to just stick with that and not include the pharmacy option because you are just trying to make a profit out of peoples sufferings while promising falsely and make us wait hopelessly do you need to wait for 7 days for your medication to arrive i think there are way more better pharmacy options out there for you to try with a small over night fee i wouldnt recommend this place to rely on a medication all the best,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

dutch has been extremely helpful to me i adopted a kitten from a somewhat shady rescue and he brought ringworm fungus into our house my dog who has serious lifetime skin issues was very susceptible and broke out in lesions dr hardin was available to answer questions within a few hours at most which was great because my dog reacted very badly to the first antifungal and had to be switched to another one and also be put on antidiarrheal and gi prescription food after trying bland diet with no success i had a lot of questions about this fungus and the doctor was very responsive imagine getting that service from your local vet not gonna happen he didnt try to upsell me either he told me ways to save money and none of the products are mandatory you only add the ones you want to your cart the only reason i gave 4 rather than 5 stars is that when you transfer a prescription to a local pharmacy if you need it very fast the process is a little sloppy but that could also be on the local pharmacys end i will still use my local vet for annuals and things that need to be seen in person but i plan to upgrade to the annual dutch subscription at my next paycheck for someone with 3 cats and a dog and an average income dutch is a lifesaver,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone use this service  ill echo the comments by so many other users that the experience with the veterinarian with whom i worked was excellent  communication was good but followthrough is nonexistent in anything close to what a reasonable person would consider to be expeditious  my 14year old female shows clear symptoms of a very bad urinary tract infection including bleeding and the veterinarian with whom i worked immediately prescribed antibiotics to begin asap   as with so many people here ive been waiting for the order i feel i was forced to place with the dutch pharmacy for three days and thats what they consider immediate when i used the word forced above its because i asked if i could have a prescription called in or receive a written script that i could take to a local pharmacy  essentially the answer was no  the explanation made no sense our internal process takes about three days anyway so the wait time would be about the same as ordering through our pharmacy   clearly the veterinarians are coached to direct people to buy medicines from dutch and equallyclearly this is part of the dutch business model  that would be fine if that business model also placed the importance of sameday or nextday delivery and critical medicine care on a plan equal to or greater than their own profitsi squarely place the blame for these business decisions on joe spector the ceo of dutch and formerly of hims  hers  in those models your viagra or finasteride can wait 5 days  when treating a living thing as precious as my lucy i need to see that the company i work with places a value commensurate with my own on my pets health and acts with appropriate urgency to deliver medications prescribed by a veterinarian  barring that outcome dutch should immediately adopt the practice of emailing a written script that can be processed at a 3rdparty pharmacy to customers rather than forcing them to buy from a pharmacy process that is sluggish nonresponsive and inappropriate to its task on a grand scaleso joe spector why isnt this fixed yet  ive seen the long list of bad reviews  when  its already too lateedit 31224 in response to dutch replydont even try it dutch  nobody and nothing in your pharmacy order process specifies two expedited order options  in fact even the one option that is meant to appear as expedited called obscurely rush isnt datespecific or even daterangespecific so theres zero assurance that anything will be different about shipping when selecting rush  the problem clearly is the business choice to use ups mail innovations for a shipping partner  thats a profit decision  ups mi is not dayspecific and the handoff to my local usps lastmile took a total of 7 days  my pharmacy order of critical antibiotics for my lucys infection wasnt treated as such by anyone but the veterinarian  thats a business choice  so its back to you joe spector,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

if i could give zero stars i would i had a visit with a very condescending vet who kept insisting she couldnt treat my dog and said he needed a behaviorist instead and dutch doesnt offer that this is after i signed up for a yearlong membership because behavioral issues were highlighted as an area they treat on their website and my dog has a fear of both the car and going to the vet in person he is already working with a certified behaviorist trainer but that person is not a prescriber the vet basically said she couldnt treat him and what i heard is that his fear aggression problems makes him a bad dog and we cant throw prozac at the problem i was not asking for that i was seeking an addition to his overall treatment plan because it takes a village and fear aggression in one of the problems prozac can help with and its even advertised that way on the dutch website then after the horrible visit where the vet refused to help me i get all these emails telling me theres a treatment plan and items in my cart but theres no plan and nothing in the cart this is a horribly misleading and disappointing service bordering on false advertising and downright fraud dont advertise virtual vet visits and then have vets say i cant treat your dog on a virtual call also ive never encountered a colder person who knew less about dogs,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

youve got to be patient and youve got to be persistent at communicating via text because thats the only way they communicate with you aside from the vet visit you have via video with one of their vets for me there were times when i wasnt very pleased about texting to get my messages of importance through to them but i was persistent and eventually i was able to solve my problem my problem was that i paid for the subscription for my pet via paypal and then i paid for the meds prescribed by the vet at dutch using my credit card and the charge did not go through paypal dutch informed me that i needed to pay in order to receive the meds for my cat i was like wait a minute i know i paid because the money came out of my account so i contacted them via text and was told the same thing then i went to my bank account and took a screenshot and sent them a shot of the money being deducted by them the person who was texting with me checked on the payment and find out that they did in fact receive my payment but admitted that some kind of glitch on their end prevented my payment from showing up the thing is they made it right what they did was they expedited my cats medicine and they overnighted it now that is the kind of service i think i deserve when ive been done a disservice thank you  dutchcom my cat is feeling better already how could i ask for more im glad that i bought a subscription and i am also glad the vet suggested an allergy medication formulated especially for cats i now own a year supply of it and the cost was very reasonable view full review users recommendation texting is the only way that their customer service works with you they are persistent but no suggestions are made so youll need to be able to think about things for yourself i thought i made both payments with paypal but found out that i had not after investigating how the second payment came out of my bank account,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

this was a very alarming and stressful experience my dog belle has an ear infection shes 10 and ive had her that whole time so i know what ear infections look like i made an appointment through dutch hoping that it would be quicker than trying to get an in person appointment with the vet shortage in the industry i have never been more wrong we had our appointment a week ago and the website says that the medication will be processed and shipped the next business day it has been several business days and i have only gotten cookiecutter responses from the company and have been unable to get any updates on her medication that she obviously needs their website and the vet that prescribe the medication did not indicate that the wait time would be so substantial especially for some thing like an infection there are no updates or communication from the company and i would not recommend it phone number is out of service and does not work and aside from what seem to be automatic emails that i am getting back i think this may have turned out to be a scam  edit august 2023 my medication shipped after i posted this review and filed a dispute with my credit card company regardless the financial investment i made was only 2040 cheaper than an in person vet if i could go back and do it again i would have gone to the urgent care vet rather than put my dog through a week of suffering waiting for medication this was not worth it and i do not recommend it one of the medications went to a different address and i had to order that product from chewy i do not recommend this service,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

update similar to some other reviews here dutch contacted trustpilot to have this review removed claiming that it was fake and not based on an actual customer experience i sent trustpilot proof of service and they verified my review as authentic dutch is spending their time trying to remove legitimate reviews instead of spending time improving their service shameful  ive never written a negative review about anything in my life however i feel the need to warn other people about the horrible service i received through dutch i actually had a great experience with my vet dr brewer however dutch actually put the health of my pet at risk due to incompetent customer service  the vet prescribed two drugs for my dog one of which was prozac i received the first shipment of medication on may 12 2023 because i only receive 30 pills at a time i would need the next shipment to be delivered by june 12 2023 realizing that the website said my recurring medication order would be placed on june 10 2023 i contacted dutch support on june 6 2023 to ensure the medication would arrive in time if not i wanted dutch to do rush shipping which i was willing to pay for during the following two days i was bounced around from person to person through email and text i could not get anyone in customer service to properly address my concern finally a person named jen promised that she would try to overnight the shipment on june 8 2023 its now june 15 2023 and the medication just shipped ups says the medication should be delivered on june 22 2023 a full 16 days after i initially made contact with dutch to expedite the medication delivery  with prozac you cant immediately stop medication and you need to wean your dog off the pills therefore i couldnt just run out of the pills i proceeded to ration the remaining pills i had and my dog is now off the medication when the pills arrive i will need to reintroduce him to the medication as you can imagine this is not great for my dogs mental health  i plead with you to find a local vet and to avoid this service if you have a problem they will not get back to you in a prompt manner and will endanger the health of your dog,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

i joined as a member and my furbaby has chronic severe pain so we were depending on the medications sent timely the first refill of medication isnt sent until i called 12 times and sent 16 emails when they finally realize they didnt send it they said were a new company well if you cannot send the actual medication the veterinarian prescribes then you shouldnt be in business the second refill still havent received despite it being on a paid subscription and membership with ongoing refills by their veterinarian  vulnerable suffering animals are depending on safe care that theyre promised and pay for now after ive spent hundreds of dollars on membership and medication i see in doing a search for lowest reviews so many other customers not receiving their medication and 27 negative reviews noted as flagged by dutch and removed  why would a company allegedly set up to care for animals charge customers a membership fee yet not send the medication my dog has been suffering and all they keep emailing is we cannot charge your card when my bank statement clearly shows the charges went through the company cannot care and deliver on the very premise they went in business for the most vulnerable population in the world they need to get out of the industry edit as of 71022 this company flagged my review a total of seven times since posting  for removal in an attempt to remove the truth if only they immersed all their efforts of removing reviews and transferred it to efforts to ship medication and honor membership i sent trustpilot all the documentation evidence of all the emails and order numbers dutch has not sent the medication albeit daniel said he would refund me the medication due to all that has happened and send it right away i received a refund for the medication but it was never shipped i was still charged 144 for an annual membership and as of 61523 they are now ignoring my emails and not refunding the amount they recently charged on 6923 i was finally refunded the membership fee on 62223,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

update we received our order today it was missing a prescription so we did finally get part of it man how can a virtual company be so systemically bad at communication thats kind of your whole thing originalthe vet we consulted with was fantastic after that its been a pretty bad experience they prescribed meds that would take several days to get and apparently transferring the prescription to a local pharmacy also takes 23 days we decided to order with expedited shipping and received an email confirmation that it would ship the next day thats the last i heard from them i reached out about shipping status the next day they said theyd check and let me know and then never replied again ive called emailed even messaged the founder on linkedin the website says to email customer care to get prescriptions transferred when i did that they told me to message the consulting vet seems silly but i did that and she said that she doesnt do it and that it needs to go through customer care then i asked customer care again and they referred us to the vet again so i placed an order for expedited shipping and now i cant get that either whats the deal it was 250 for the service and 160 for the prescriptions how can i not get any help,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
i setup an online vet appointment worried that my dog might have ringworm or mites this cost 30 with a reoccurring monthly charge regardless if i use it or not the vet was ok and said she would send a prescription she also said that if i transferred it to someplace other than dutch they charge a 10 fee the prescription appeared on the website right away and it said delivery was 5 days but it only showed a total charge of 54 no dosage or quantity hiding this info prevented me from shopping around to compare prices  so my dog is in quarantine and im checking my mail and the web every day for tracking info or anything but no updates after 4 days i tried to call dutch it was on a thursday at 1216 pm the automated system said i had an 8 minute wait time then a 2 minute wait time then i was sent to voice mail and told to leave a message basically someone didnt want to answer the phone and dumped my call so i sent an email asking for an update and tracking info on the prescription kat responded saying it had been shipped and provided tracking info but wait the info she sent said nothing had been shipped and the label was scheduled to be printed later that night i responded asking them to send me the prescription so i could get it filled someplace else since it should have been delivered by now and not just getting around to printing a label i also asked them to wave the 10 transfer fee since i had given them a chance and nothing was happening no response so i sent it again after 3 days i get an email saying they cant cancel an order that has already been shipped are you kidding me they ignored my request till they finally got around to shipping it just to use that lame excuse completely ridiculous so 10 days after my meeting with the vet the prescription finally arrives only after this did the quantity and dosage appear on the dutch website covering this up till after the delivery obviously benefits them because it turned out chewy is 264 less than dutch i will never use them again and recommend avoiding them at all cost,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

believe me when i say i was extremely skeptical of dutch when my husband first mentioned it  the reviews were very mixed our older pup  alex had developed a very intense skin infection on his face that was progressively getting worse by the day we have very tight schedules with work  so my husband found dutch and set up an appointment through zoom with a doctor which took only 15 mins we sent her very clear pics of our dogs problem before the appointment so she already was aware of the issue along with us providing detailed info on the intake form and within 2 days the medication for our sweet pup was delivered to our home she also broke down what each medication was for exactly in a very thorough message which was very helpful i highly recommend this company  we will definitely continue to use them thank you to everyone on the dutch team ,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

terrible company i explained i needed my cats prescription renewed in the appointment reason section the vet connected with me video chatting while driving a car for 2 minutes to tell me they cant do cat prescriptions i asked why they couldnt just tell me that and cancel the appointment instead of wasting my time they refunded me and cancelled my subscription i have two seperate emails confirming they cancelled well a month later they charged me again this is an scam to try to get people to forget they have a subscription and charge monthly they commit fraud when they say that your subscription is cancelled but still charge you can also only cancel through email and there is no way to remove your payment method on the website i have had to report the fraud to my credit card do not use  i sent 3 emails to dutch responding to the feb 7 confirmation that my subscription was cancelled telling them to refund my money and remove my information from their website instead of responding they marked my trustpilot review as illegal charging a credit card you are not authorized to charge  fraud its clear they try hard to scrub negative reviews online,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

after seeing the good reviews i figured id give it a shot my dog has been dealing with some skin issues and i was really looking forward to her being prescribed a strong topical or oral prescription id made a point to tell the vet i have tried numerous otc items with no success the vet said that they would prescribe some stuff after the call and id see it in my profile and then i approve or deny the items ok great well things turned out not so great i take a look after the call and see that every item they prescribed is otc not only that but the vet threw in items to treat tear stains when i never mentioned my dog having them she never has and the prices were ridiculous every item listed i could get a better product off amazon for the same price half the price and even a third of the price i also learned that the shipping process is not quick but amazon i can get those items next day even chewy would be quicker honestly i would like to rate two stars but im not sure if i just had bad luck with the one vet i saw so i dont want to speak for others and say this service is a complete waste there may be vets that actually listen and are helpful sadly i did not get one of them,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"
